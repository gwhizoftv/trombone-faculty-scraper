You have access to Playwright MCP and filesystem MCP servers. 
For each university in the CSV file, you need to:

1. Navigate to the university website
2. QUICKLY find search - CHECK THESE LOCATIONS IN ORDER:
   a. TOP RIGHT corner of page (90% of sites put search here)
   b. TOP navigation bar/header
   c. Look for magnifying glass icon (üîç) in header
   d. "Search" text link in top navigation
3. Search for "trombone faculty" or "trombone professor" (NOT just "trombone")
4. Click on each trombone faculty member's profile
5. EXTRACT CONTACT INFO (CRITICAL):
   - Email address (look for @ symbol, mailto: links)
   - Phone number (look for patterns like xxx-xxx-xxxx, (xxx) xxx-xxxx)
   - Name and title
   - Profile URL
6. Save the results to a CSV file with ALL contact information

SPEED TIPS TO FIND SEARCH FASTER:
- FIRST: Check top-right corner (most common location)
- Look for these selectors quickly:
  * button[aria-label*="search" i]
  * .search-icon, .search-button, .search-toggle
  * svg with magnifying glass shape in header
  * input[type="search"] or input[placeholder*="search" i]
- Don't scan the entire page - focus on header/top area first
- If no search in header after 10 seconds, try direct URL patterns:
  * /search, /faculty, /directory, /people

BETTER SEARCH TERMS (use these instead of just "trombone"):
- "trombone faculty" (most effective)
- "trombone professor"
- "brass faculty" then look for trombone
- faculty name if you know it (e.g., from previous research)

Be intelligent and adaptive:
- If search doesn't work, try navigating through menus (Music Department, Faculty, etc.)
- Look for patterns in URLs (e.g., /faculty, /people, /directory)
- Handle different page layouts and structures
- If one approach fails, try another

Remember: You can SEE the page, so make intelligent decisions about what to click.
