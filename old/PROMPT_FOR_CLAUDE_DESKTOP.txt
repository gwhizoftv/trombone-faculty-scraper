I need you to help me scrape trombone faculty information from university websites using your Playwright and filesystem MCP servers.

STEP 1: Navigate to https://berklee.edu

STEP 2: Find the search function
- FIRST check TOP RIGHT corner (most common location for search)
- Look for magnifying glass icon üîç
- If not found in 10 seconds, try URL: https://berklee.edu/search

STEP 3: Search for "trombone faculty" (not just "trombone")

STEP 4: Click on each trombone faculty member's profile

STEP 5: Extract and save this information:
- Faculty name
- Title
- EMAIL ADDRESS (required - look for @ symbol)
- PHONE NUMBER (if available)
- Profile URL

STEP 6: Write the results to a CSV file called trombone_faculty_results.csv with these columns:
University, Faculty Name, Title, Email, Phone, Profile URL

After Berklee, process these universities next:
2. Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory - http://www.bw.edu/academics/conservatory
3. Manhattan School of Music - https://www.msmnyc.edu
4. Juilliard School - https://www.juilliard.edu
5. New England Conservatory - https://necmusic.edu

For each university, follow the same steps. If search doesn't work, try navigating to /faculty or /people or look for "Music Department" ‚Üí "Faculty" in menus.

IMPORTANT: Focus on finding EMAIL addresses - check for mailto: links, @ symbols, or "Contact" sections on faculty pages.
