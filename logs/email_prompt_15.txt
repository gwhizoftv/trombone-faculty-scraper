URL: http://www.newschool.edu/mannes

CRITICAL: Find email addresses for these 5 faculty members:
- Demian Austin
- Sasha Romero
- Jack Schatz
- Nicholas Schwartz
- David Taylor

DEEP SEARCH STRATEGY:

1. GOOGLE SEARCH FIRST for each faculty member:
   - Search: "[Faculty Name]" (full name in quotes)
   - Look for their personal website → Contact page
   - Check for social media profiles (Instagram @username often has email)
   - YouTube channel → Click "...more" in description for email (christoflur@gmail.com example)

2. COURSICLE.COM SEARCH:
   - Go to coursicle.com
   - Search for the university
   - Search for faculty name in the school's search
   - Click on faculty profile if found (often shows email like cliftone@apsu.edu)

3. GOOGLE EMAIL PATTERN:
   - Search: "firstname.lastname@university.edu"
   - Try variations: first.last, flast, firstl, etc.
   - Look for the email in cached pages or PDFs

4. UNIVERSITY WEBSITE:
   - Navigate to main URL
   - Look for search bar in upper right - search faculty name
   - Try these specific pages:
     - /directory
     - /faculty-directory
     - /people
     - /contact
     - /faculty-staff
     - /music/faculty
     - /music/directory
     - /about/directory

5. SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES:
   - Check Instagram bio (@chrishernacki example)
   - Facebook profile/page
   - Twitter/X bio
   - LinkedIn contact info

This is a SECOND PASS - be extremely thorough!
