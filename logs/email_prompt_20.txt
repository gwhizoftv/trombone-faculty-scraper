EMAIL FINDING MISSION #20: Portland State University

DEEP SEARCH STRATEGY:

1. GOOGLE SEARCH FIRST for each faculty member:
   - Search: "[Faculty Name]" (full name in quotes)
   - Look for their personal website → Contact page
   - Check for social media profiles (Instagram @username often has email)
   - YouTube channel → Click "...more" in description for email (christoflur@gmail.com example)

2. COURSICLE.COM SEARCH (if site allows access):
   - Go to coursicle.com
   - Search for the university
   - Search for faculty name in the school's search
   - If profile appears, note the URL pattern
   - Try navigating directly to: coursicle.com/[university]/professors/[FirstName]+[LastName]
   - If blocked or fails, try Google: "site:coursicle.com [Faculty Name] [University]"
   - Look for email on the profile page (often shows email like cliftone@apsu.edu)

3. GOOGLE EMAIL PATTERN:
   - Search: "firstname.lastname@university.edu"
   - Try variations: first.last, flast, firstl, etc.
   - Look for the email in cached pages or PDFs

4. UNIVERSITY WEBSITE:
   - Navigate to main URL
   - Look for search bar in upper right - search faculty name
   - Try these specific pages:
     - /directory

     - /contact
     - /faculty-staff
     - /music/faculty
