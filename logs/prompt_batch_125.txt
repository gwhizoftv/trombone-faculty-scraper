Process university #126: The University of Akron
URL: http://uakron.edu

CRITICAL: EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE REQUIRED - Without emails, the data is useless!

STEPS:
1. Navigate to URL
2. IMMEDIATELY write this URL to: /Volumes/8TB-SSD/TotalVU Dropbox/Michael Williams/Adrienne Albert Website/trombone marketing-claude1/tmp/uni_126_urls.txt
3. Search for trombone faculty
4. For EACH faculty member found:
   - Click on their profile/bio page
   - Look for email on their individual page
   - Check faculty directory pages
   - Look for "contact" or "email" links
   - Check department contact pages
5. For EVERY new page/URL you visit, append it to: /Volumes/8TB-SSD/TotalVU Dropbox/Michael Williams/Adrienne Albert Website/trombone marketing-claude1/tmp/uni_126_urls.txt
6. Write results to: /Volumes/8TB-SSD/TotalVU Dropbox/Michael Williams/Adrienne Albert Website/trombone marketing-claude1/results/batches/uni_126.csv
   Headers: University,Faculty Name,Title,Email,Phone,Profile URL,Notes
   
ESSENTIAL: 
- DO NOT save faculty without email addresses
- If no email found after checking profile, mark as "NO EMAIL FOUND - SKIP"
- Spend extra time searching for emails - they are often on separate contact pages

7. Update LAST_PROCESSED=126 in progress_tracker.txt
8. Say only: "Done #126"

If NO trombone faculty WITH EMAILS: write to results/no_trombone_found.csv
Try /faculty, /music, /directory, /contact pages.
