Process university #12: Boston University
URL: https://bu.edu/

CRITICAL: EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE REQUIRED - Without emails, the data is useless!

STEPS:
1. Navigate to URL
2. IMMEDIATELY write this URL to: tmp/uni_012_urls.txt
3. SEARCH FOR PIANO:
   - First: Look for search bar (usually upper right of page) - type "piano faculty"
   - If no search bar: Navigate to School of Music or Faculty pages
   - Click search results and explore thoroughly
4. For EACH faculty member found:
   - Click on their profile/bio page
   - Look for email on their individual page
   - Check faculty directory pages
   - Look for "contact" or "email" links
   - Check department contact pages
5. For EVERY new page/URL you visit, append it to: tmp/uni_012_urls.txt
6. Write results to: results/batches/uni_012.csv
   Headers: University,Faculty Name,Title,Email,Phone,Profile URL,Notes
   
ESSENTIAL: 
- DO NOT save faculty without email addresses
- If no email found after checking profile, mark as "NO EMAIL FOUND - SKIP"
- Spend extra time searching for emails - they are often on separate contact pages

7. Update LAST_PROCESSED=12 in progress_tracker.txt
8. Say only: "Done #12"

SEARCH PRIORITY:
1. Use search bar in upper right (type "piano faculty")
2. Try /faculty, /music, /directory, /contact pages
3. School of Music page
4. Faculty directory
5. Music faculty list

If NO piano faculty WITH EMAILS: write to results/no_piano_found.csv
